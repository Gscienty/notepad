#Context-free Grammars#
A context-free grammar consists of a number of *productions*. Each production has a abstract symbol called a *nonterminal* as its **left-hand side**, and a sequence of one or more nonterminal and terminal symbols as its **right-hand side**.  
The terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.

Starting from a sentence consisting of  
a single distinguished nonterminal, called the *goal symbol*,  
a given context-free grammar specifies a language, namely, the set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.
